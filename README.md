# dg_python
Dichotomous Gaussian model implemented in python

To install, clone the repository and run *pip install dg_python* from within the local directory containing the repository.

*demo_dg_spont.ipynb* demonstrates how to use the DG model implemented here to generate spontaneous spike trains, and to fit a DG model to spontaneous data.

*demo_dg_timevar_frate.ipynb* demonstrates how to use the DG model implemented here to generate spike trains with a time-varying firing rate and fixed covariance matrix, and to fit a DG model to such data.
